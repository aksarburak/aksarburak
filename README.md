<div align="left">

Hey, this is Burak, your friendly neighborhood bartender! I'm currently pursuing a Computer Engineering PhD degree in the field of applied machine learning. I love building end-to-end solutions across different domains - the hackiest solutions possible - yes, I know it gets [hackier](https://youtu.be/yKg_3kyIhHc). 

PhD in Computer Engineering @ [Boston University - PeacLab](https://www.bu.edu/peaclab/)

My goal is to develop scalable and commercial AI products - not if-elses, see [here](ai_scam.png). I enjoy following the latest news in the startup world. My tech stack and some stuff that I have experience on: 

- Python, C++
- Tensorflow, Pytorch
- Dask, Scrapy
- AWS (ECS, Lambda, Sagemaker, Step Functions, GraphQL, ECR) 
- Flask, Django, Docker
- Learning: Node.js, React, and Typescript - Only when I have time
- I might know a little bit more than what you read here but we gotta find a reason to have a cup of coffee, right? 


We all should follow Linus Torvalds' advice: *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code"* So, the best way to get in touch is DMing your code on Twitter.
